Hello world. I'm James Hancock, a Computer Science with Innovation student at the University of Bristol.

This is a blog of the self-guided learning I'm doing outside of my degree. It's split up into several months, I started this process in January 2019, with the ["everydays"](https://jhancock532.github.io/everydays/) project, then transitioned to a less regular learning regime as other responsibilities took up more of my time.
